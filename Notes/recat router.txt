What is a React Router?
React Router is a standard library for routing in React.
It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, 
allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

Features of React Router
Declarative Routing: React Router v6 uses the Routes and Route components to define routes declaratively,
 making the routing configuration simple and easy to read.
Nested Routes: It supports nested routes, allowing for complex and hierarchical routing structures, 
which helps in organizing the application better.
Programmatic Navigation: The useNavigate hook enables programmatic navigation, allowing developers to 
navigate between routes based on certain conditions or user actions.
Route Parameters: It provides dynamic routing with route parameters, enabling the creation of routes that 
can match multiple URL patterns.
Improved TypeScript Support: Enhanced TypeScript support ensures that developers can build type-safe 
applications, improving development efficiency and reducing errors.



Components of React Router
1. BrowserRouter and HashRouter
BrowserRouter: Uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
HashRouter: Uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e., window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
2. Routes and Route
Routes: A container for all your route definitions.
Route: Defines a single route with a path and the component to render.
3. Link and NavLink
Link: Creates navigational links in your application.
NavLink: Similar to Link but provides additional styling attributes when the link is active.
