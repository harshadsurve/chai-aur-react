What is a React Router?
React Router is a standard library for routing in React.
It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, 
allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

Features of React Router
Declarative Routing: React Router v6 uses the Routes and Route components to define routes declaratively,
 making the routing configuration simple and easy to read.
Nested Routes: It supports nested routes, allowing for complex and hierarchical routing structures, 
which helps in organizing the application better.
Programmatic Navigation: The useNavigate hook enables programmatic navigation, allowing developers to 
navigate between routes based on certain conditions or user actions.
Route Parameters: It provides dynamic routing with route parameters, enabling the creation of routes that 
can match multiple URL patterns.
Improved TypeScript Support: Enhanced TypeScript support ensures that developers can build type-safe 
applications, improving development efficiency and reducing errors.



Components of React Router
1. RouterProvider
<RouterProvider /> is a component from React Router that makes the routing configuration available throughout your entire React app.
 It ensures that the right page or component is shown based on the current URL.

2. BrowserRouter
BrowserRouter:createBrowserRouter is a function from React Router that sets up routing for a React app. 
It allows you to define which pages or components should be displayed for different URLs in your app.
 When the URL changes (like when a user clicks a link), the router shows the appropriate component or page.
 
3. Link and NavLink
Link: Creates navigational links in your application. link use in place of a tag.
NavLink: Similar to Link but provides additional styling attributes when the link is active. 

4.Routes
Routes are perhaps the most important part of a React Router app.
They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations.

5. Outlet
<Outlet> is a component from React Router used in your app to display child components based on the current route.
 It's like a placeholder that gets filled with the component that matches the URL path. 
 For example, in a layout with nested routes, <Outlet> will show the child route's content.

6. loader
In React Router, a loader is a function that runs before a component is rendered to fetch data or perform other tasks. 
It prepares any needed data for a page or component and ensures that this data is available when the component is displayed.
