What is Context API?
Context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code. 
It helps when there is a need for sharing state between a lot of nested components.
It is light in weight and easier to use, to create a context just need to call React.createContext().
 No need to install other dependencies or third-party libraries like redux for state management.

 Why is context API used?
Context API solves the problem of prop drilling in React. 
Prop Drilling occurs when data is to be passed between multiple layers before finally sending it to the required component.
This makes the application slower

Working of Context API
To work with Context API we need React.createContext. 
It has two properties Provider and Consumer.
The Provider acts as a parent it passes the state to its children whereas the Consumer uses the state that has been passed.
