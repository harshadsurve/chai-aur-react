REACT:-
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs). 
It is developed by Facebook. React is known for its component-based architecture which allows 
you to create reusable UI elements, making complex web applications easier to manage and maintain. 
React is used to build single-page applications.

Features of React
1. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension):
JSX combines HTML and JavaScript, allowing you to embed JavaScript objects within HTML elements.
It enhances code readability and simplifies UI development.
Example:
const name = "GeekforGeeks";
const ele = <h1>Welcome to {name}</h1>;

2. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model):
React uses a virtual DOM, which is an exact copy of the real DOM.
When there are modifications in the web application, React updates the virtual DOM first and then computes the differences between the real DOM and the virtual DOM.
This approach minimizes unnecessary re-rendering and improves performance.

3. One-way Data Binding:
React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent components to child components.
Child components cannot directly return data to their parent components, but they can communicate with parents to modify states based on provided inputs.

4. Performance:
Reactâ€™s virtual DOM and component-based architecture contribute to better performance.
Separate components allow efficient rendering and faster execution.

5. Extension:
React has a rich ecosystem and supports various extensions.
Explore tools like Flux, Redux, and React Native for mobile app development and server-side rendering.

6. Conditional Statements in JSX:
JSX allows writing conditional statements directly.
Display data in the browser based on provided conditions.
Example:
const age = 12;
if (age >= 10) {
  return <p>Greater than {age}</p>;
} else {
  return <p>{age}</p>;
}

7. Components:
React divides web pages into reusable and immutable components.
Component-based development simplifies code organization and maintenance.
