REACT:-
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs). 
It is developed by Facebook. React is known for its component-based architecture which allows 
you to create reusable UI elements, making complex web applications easier to manage and maintain. 
React is used to build single-page applications.

Features of React
1. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension):
JSX combines HTML and JavaScript, allowing you to embed JavaScript objects within HTML elements.
It enhances code readability and simplifies UI development.
Example:
const name = "GeekforGeeks";
const ele = <h1>Welcome to {name}</h1>;

2. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model):
React uses a virtual DOM, which is an exact copy of the real DOM.
When there are modifications in the web application, React updates the virtual DOM first and then computes the differences between the real DOM and the virtual DOM.
This approach minimizes unnecessary re-rendering and improves performance.

3. One-way Data Binding:
React follows one-way data binding, where data flows from parent components to child components.
Child components cannot directly return data to their parent components, but they can communicate with parents to modify states based on provided inputs.

4. Performance:
Reactâ€™s virtual DOM and component-based architecture contribute to better performance.
Separate components allow efficient rendering and faster execution.

5. Extension:
React has a rich ecosystem and supports various extensions.
Explore tools like Flux, Redux, and React Native for mobile app development and server-side rendering.

6. Conditional Statements in JSX:
JSX allows writing conditional statements directly.
Display data in the browser based on provided conditions.
Example:
const age = 12;
if (age >= 10) {
  return <p>Greater than {age}</p>;
} else {
  return <p>{age}</p>;
}

7. Components:
React divides web pages into reusable and immutable components.
Component-based development simplifies code organization and maintenance.

react project create = 1. npe(node packge executor) create-react-app project-name
                       go to folder cd project-name
                       dir (see packge.json)
                       npm run start

                       npm run build
                       create build folder (js convert in , build server users)
2.
 Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like Vite. bundler 
          npm create vite@latest
          project name:- project-name
          select a framework (React)
          select a variant (javaScript)
           cd my-project
            npm install 
            npm run dev


<></>(fragments for return 1 more more HTML ELEMENTS)
when you create component function name is capital first alphabet
file name capital (vite or  when you return HTML component name JSX ) file extensions


when you use  veriable  is render than use Syntax {veriable-name}

const reactElement = React.createElement(
  'a',  // 1. The type of the HTML element to create, in this case, an anchor tag (<a>).
  {href:'https://www.google.com', target:'_blank'},  // 2. The props object containing the attributes for the element.
  'click me to visit google',  // 3. The children of the element, in this case, a text node.
  anotheruser  // 4. Additional children (could be another element or component).
);



A bundler is a tool that takes all your JavaScript code, along with any other assets like CSS or images,
 and combines them into a single file (or a few files) that can be served to the browser
